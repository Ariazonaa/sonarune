# Architecture — how Sonarune works

This page shows how the backend works, in diagrams. Every diagram
below is [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) and renders directly on Gitea/GitHub.
The goal: show *how the backend actually works* without reading the whole Rust
tree first.

Two rules explain almost everything:

1. **The WebView renders UI and nothing else.** No audio, no HTTP, no tokens in
   the DOM. Every Jellyfin request and every sample of audio goes through Rust.
2. **The queue is a single source of truth in Rust.** The UI never computes
   playback state — it mirrors what the player thread emits.

---

## 1. The big picture

Two worlds joined by **Tauri commands** (UI → Rust) and **events** (Rust → UI).

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph WV["WebView — Svelte 5 SPA"]
        direction TB
        R["routes / components"]
        S["runes state stores<br/>(mirror Rust state)"]
        R --- S
    end

    subgraph RS["Rust — Tauri 2"]
        direction TB
        CMD["commands*.rs<br/>(invoke surface)"]
        API["api/ — JellyfinClient<br/>reqwest + rustls pinning"]
        PLAYER["player/ — sonarune-player thread<br/>rodio · Symphonia · DSP · SMTC"]
        STORE["store.rs — SQLite kv"]
        PROTO["proto.rs — jfimg:// cover art"]
        CMD --> API
        CMD --> PLAYER
        CMD --> STORE
    end

    subgraph EXT["Outside the app"]
        JF["Jellyfin server<br/>10.11+"]
        OUT["Audio output<br/>(cpal device)"]
        CRED["OS Credential Manager<br/>(tokens)"]
    end

    S -- "invoke()" --> CMD
    PLAYER -- "events:<br/>player:state / player:queue / player:error" --> S
    PROTO -- "jfimg:// image bytes" --> WV

    API <-- "HTTPS (auth, browse, stream)" --> JF
    PLAYER -- "PCM" --> OUT
    CMD -- "access token" --> CRED

    classDef web fill:#1e293b,stroke:#334155,color:#e2e8f0;
    classDef rust fill:#3b2415,stroke:#7c4a1e,color:#fde3c8;
    classDef ext fill:#0f2a1e,stroke:#1f5c40,color:#c7f0d8;
    class WV,R,S web;
    class RS,CMD,API,PLAYER,STORE,PROTO rust;
    class EXT,JF,OUT,CRED ext;
```

**Why this split matters:** because Rust owns HTTP, plain-HTTP and self-signed
home servers "just work", tokens never touch the DOM, and the audio path is not
at the mercy of a browser's media stack.

---

## 2. AppState — what the backend owns

At startup `lib.rs::run()` builds one `AppState` and hands clones of the shared
pieces to every subsystem.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    APP["AppState (lib.rs)"]
    APP --> ST["store: Arc&lt;Store&gt;<br/>SQLite kv (settings, queue snapshot)"]
    APP --> SES["session: SharedSession<br/>Arc&lt;RwLock&lt;Option&lt;Arc&lt;JellyfinClient&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;"]
    APP --> PH["player: PlayerHandle<br/>→ sonarune-player OS thread"]
    APP --> LW["library_watch: LibraryWatchHandle"]
    APP -.managed.-> DM["DownloadManager"]
    APP -.managed.-> CC["CoverCache"]

    SES -. "read().await (commands)" .-> PH
    SES -. "blocking_read() (player thread)" .-> PH

    classDef box fill:#3b2415,stroke:#7c4a1e,color:#fde3c8;
    class APP,ST,SES,PH,LW,DM,CC box;
```

`SharedSession` is the one `JellyfinClient` shared between the async command
world and the plain-OS-thread player. Commands take it with `read().await`; the
player thread (not inside the async runtime) uses `blocking_read()`.

---

## 3. The player thread

A single dedicated OS thread named `sonarune-player` owns the audio output, the
queue, playback reporting and the Windows SMTC for the whole app lifetime. It is
driven by an mpsc channel with a **400 ms timeout** — commands when they arrive,
a periodic `tick()` when they don't.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph MAIN["Main / command threads (async)"]
        U["UI invoke → commands.rs"]
    end

    subgraph WORKER["sonarune-player OS thread"]
        LOOP{{"recv_timeout(400ms)"}}
        H["handle(cmd)"]
        T["tick()"]
        W["Worker state<br/>queue · index · status · sink · generation"]
        LOOP -- "Ok(cmd)" --> H
        LOOP -- "Timeout" --> T
        H --> W
        T --> W
    end

    subgraph OPEN["short-lived 'sonarune-open' threads"]
        O["open_track_source()<br/>(decode probe, HTTP stream)"]
    end

    U -- "PlayerCommand (mpsc)" --> LOOP
    H -- "spawn_open()" --> O
    O -- "SourceReady{generation,...} (mpsc)" --> LOOP
    W -- "emit()" --> EV["events → UI<br/>player:state / player:queue / player:error"]
    W -- "append/pause/seek" --> SINK["rodio::Player → cpal"]

    classDef box fill:#3b2415,stroke:#7c4a1e,color:#fde3c8;
    classDef ev fill:#1e293b,stroke:#334155,color:#e2e8f0;
    class WORKER,LOOP,H,T,W,OPEN,O,MAIN,U,SINK box;
    class EV ev;
```

**Never block the loop.** Sources are opened on throwaway `sonarune-open`
threads and delivered back as a `SourceReady` command; a `generation` counter
lets the worker throw away results that a newer play/seek has already
invalidated.

### What the 400 ms tick does

```mermaid

    T0["tick()"] --> A["retry deferred output failure"]
    A --> B["drop finished crossfade tails"]
    B --> C["maybe_transition()<br/>gapless / end-of-track"]
    C --> D["sleep-timer fade + deadline"]
    D --> E["progress report every ~25 ticks (~10s)"]
    E --> F["schedule_prefetch()"]
    F --> G["maybe_auto_dj()"]
    G --> H["update SMTC + emit()"]

    classDef box fill:#3b2415,stroke:#7c4a1e,color:#fde3c8;
    class T0,A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H box;
```

---

## 4. The audio source chain

Every playing track is a stack of iterator wrappers. Each `next()` sample flows
from the decoder outward:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    DEC["EitherSource<br/>Symphonia (flac/mp3/vorbis/wav)<br/>or libopus (Ogg-Opus)"]
    DSP["DspSource<br/>normalization → 10-band EQ → clamp"]
    FADE["FadeSource<br/>gain ramp: crossfade +<br/>click-free pause/resume"]
    TAP["TapSource<br/>stereo fold → visualizer IPC"]
    SINK["rodio::Player"]
    CPAL["cpal output device"]

    DEC --> DSP --> FADE --> TAP --> SINK --> CPAL

    classDef box fill:#3b2415,stroke:#7c4a1e,color:#fde3c8;
    class DEC,DSP,FADE,TAP,SINK,CPAL box;
```

- **DSP** is live-editable: it polls a revision counter every ~1024 samples, so
  EQ/normalization changes apply without reopening the stream.
- **Fade** is sample-accurate and steered by a shared handle — it powers both
  crossfade and click-free pause/resume.
- **Tap** is the outermost wrapper and costs *an atomic load and a sample
  counter* per sample when no visualizer is open (the counter keeps left/right
  aligned when a feed starts mid-stream); otherwise it folds any layout to
  stereo and ships 2048-frame interleaved L/R frames over a bounded queue so the
  audio callback never blocks.

---

## 5. Gapless vs. crossfade

The next track is prepared *before* the current one ends. Which path is taken
depends on the crossfade setting and whether the two tracks form an album
sequence.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant Tick as tick() loop
    participant Open as sonarune-open
    participant Sink as rodio::Player

    Note over Tick: ~20s remaining
    Tick->>Open: spawn_open(Prefetch, next)
    Open-->>Tick: SourceReady → self.prefetched

    alt Gapless (no crossfade / album sequence)
        Note over Tick: ~3s remaining
        Tick->>Sink: sink.append(next)  (same sink)
        Note over Tick,Sink: sink.len() drops to 1
        Tick->>Tick: handle_transition() → index++, promote fade/tap
    else Crossfade (opt-in, non-album boundary)
        Note over Tick: fade window
        Tick->>Sink: new Player, fade-in next
        Tick->>Sink: ramp old sink → 0, mute its tap
        Tick->>Tick: index moves immediately; drop old tail after fade
    end
```

`rodio`'s position tracker follows the current source, so the reported position
resets automatically at the boundary — no manual bookkeeping for gapless.

---

## 6. Playing an album (end-to-end)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant UI as WebView
    participant CMD as commands.rs
    participant API as JellyfinClient
    participant JF as Jellyfin
    participant P as player thread
    participant O as sonarune-open

    UI->>CMD: invoke("play_album", {albumId})
    CMD->>API: with_retry(album_tracks)
    API->>JF: GET /Items?parentId=… (Token header)
    JF-->>API: tracks (PascalCase DTOs)
    API-->>CMD: TrackDto[] (camelCase)
    CMD->>P: PlayerCommand::PlayQueue{tracks,start_index}
    P->>O: spawn_open(Play, current)
    O->>JF: GET /Audio/{id}/universal?…playSessionId=…
    JF-->>O: audio stream
    O-->>P: SourceReady{generation, source}
    P->>P: sink.append(source), status=Playing
    P-->>UI: event player:state + player:queue
    P->>JF: POST /Sessions/Playing (report_start)
```

Each queued track carries a `playSessionId` generated at queue-build time. It is
embedded both in the stream URL and in the `/Sessions/Playing*` reports so the
server can correlate — and later kill — transcode jobs.

---

## 7. Auto-relogin on 401

Every server command is wrapped in `with_retry`. A dead token triggers a silent
re-login using the password stored in the OS credential manager, then the call
is retried exactly once.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant CMD as command
    participant API as JellyfinClient
    participant JF as Jellyfin
    participant CRED as Credential Manager

    CMD->>API: call(client)
    API->>JF: GET /… (Token header)
    JF-->>API: 401 Unauthorized
    API-->>CMD: Err(Server{401})
    CMD->>CRED: read stored password
    CMD->>JF: POST /Users/AuthenticateByName
    JF-->>CMD: new token
    CMD->>CRED: store new token
    CMD->>API: call(client) — retry once
    API->>JF: GET /… (new Token)
    JF-->>API: 200 OK
```

`validate()` distinguishes a *dead token* (401/403 → log out) from an
*unreachable server* (network error → stay logged in, show offline banner).

---

## 8. Certificate pinning (self-signed home servers)

There is **no blanket "accept invalid certs"**. A custom rustls verifier checks
the OS trust store first and only accepts an untrusted leaf whose SHA-256
fingerprint the user has explicitly pinned.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant UI as WebView
    participant CMD as connect()
    participant V as PinningVerifier (rustls)
    participant STORE as SQLite (trusted_certs)

    UI->>CMD: connect(url, user, pass)
    CMD->>V: TLS handshake
    V->>V: fingerprint(leaf) = SHA-256
    alt OS trust store accepts (public CA)
        V-->>CMD: verified
    else untrusted leaf
        V->>STORE: is fingerprint pinned for this server?
        alt pinned
            V-->>CMD: verified (assertion)
        else not pinned
            V-->>CMD: rejected (observed fingerprint recorded)
            CMD-->>UI: ConnectResult::CertUntrusted{fingerprint}
            UI->>CMD: connect(..., trust_fingerprint)
            CMD->>V: rebuild client trusting fp for this attempt only
            V-->>CMD: verified
            CMD->>STORE: pin_fingerprint(server, fp) — only after the login succeeded, replaces the old pin
        end
    end
```

Fingerprints are stored **per `server_url`** in SQLite, so pinning one home
server never weakens another.

---

## 9. Cover art — the jfimg:// protocol

The WebView can't fetch authenticated images itself (no token in the DOM), so a
custom, disk-cached protocol does it.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant WV as WebView &lt;img&gt;
    participant P as proto.rs (jfimg)
    participant FS as disk cache
    participant API as JellyfinClient
    participant JF as Jellyfin

    WV->>P: GET jfimg://…/{itemId}/{tag}/{size}
    alt cache hit
        P->>FS: read + touch (mtime for LRU)
        FS-->>P: bytes
    else cache miss
        P->>API: fetch_image(itemId, tag, size)
        API->>JF: GET /Items/{id}/Images/Primary
        JF-->>API: image bytes
        P->>FS: write temp → atomic rename
        P->>FS: schedule LRU eviction (to 80% headroom)
    end
    P-->>WV: bytes + Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
```

The `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` header is what lets the frontend read cover
pixels into a canvas (for the ambient now-playing backdrop) without tainting it.
Windows SMTC artwork reuses the same disk cache via `file://` URLs.

## 10. Where things live on disk

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph DISK["Per-installation storage"]
        SQL["SQLite sonarune.db<br/>settings · device_id · trusted certs · queue snapshot"]
        CRED["OS Credential Manager<br/>access token · password · ListenBrainz token"]
        CACHE["Cover cache dir<br/>{itemId}-{tag}-{size}.img (LRU, MB-capped)"]
    end

    NOTE["Secrets never touch SQLite.<br/>export/import settings strip tokens + queue + identity."]:::note
    CRED --- NOTE

    classDef note fill:#2a1e0f,stroke:#5c401f,color:#f0d8c7;
    class SQL,CRED,CACHE box;
```

## Reading order in the source

If you want to follow this in code:

| Concern | Start here |
| --- | --- |
| App wiring, managed state | `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` |
| Invoke surface | `src-tauri/src/commands*.rs` |
| Player thread & queue | `src-tauri/src/player/mod.rs` |
| Source chain | `src-tauri/src/player/{source,dsp,fade,tap,opus}.rs` |
| HTTP client | `src-tauri/src/api/{mod,types}.rs` |
| TLS pinning | `src-tauri/src/tls.rs` |
| Cover art | `src-tauri/src/proto.rs`, `src-tauri/src/cache.rs` |
| Storage | `src-tauri/src/store.rs` |

The rules those modules are written against, in short: the WebView never
touches audio or HTTP, user-facing strings live in `messages/{en,de}.json`, and
colors come from the design tokens in `src/app.css`.
